import Ataxx

-- | Type of AI functions you can choose to write.
data AIFunc
  = NoLookahead (GameState -> Move)
    -- ^ Simple AIs that do not need lookahead.
  | WithLookahead (GameState -> Int -> Move)
    -- ^ AIs that want to look ahead. The assignment framework will
    -- call the function over and over with increasing integer
    -- arguments @1, 2, 3, ...@ until your AI's time limit is up.

-- | The table of all AIs that your assignment provides. The AI named
-- "default" in this table is the one your tutor will dedicate most of
-- his or her attention to marking.
ais :: [(String, AIFunc)]
ais = [ ("firstLegalMove", NoLookahead firstLegalMove)
      ]

-- | A very simple AI, which picks the first move returned by the
-- 'legalMoves' function. AIs can rely on the 'legalMoves' list being
-- non-empty; if there were no legal moves, the framework would have
-- ended the game.
firstLegalMove :: GameState -> Move
firstLegalMove st = head (legalMoves st)
